**Original open-source ECU hex editor and tuning app with AI guidance, datalog viewing, and OBD2/J2534 integration.**  
Built in Python for automotive enthusiasts, inspired by community tools but focused on innovation like AI-assisted optimizations and hardware support. No copying of proprietary code‚Äîethical development only.

## üéØ Project Overview
CashoutHexEditor is a modern, free alternative to tools like WinOLS or TunerPro, emphasizing originality with features like AI-powered tune recommendations, real-time datalog viewing, and hardware interfaces (ELM327, J2534, SavvyCAN). It supports hex editing for ECU files, map visualization, safety checks, and integration with tuning ecosystems like HP Tuners (e.g., CSV log analysis, vehicle lists).

Key differentiators:
- AI guidance for map detection, optimizations, and datalog analysis (e.g., flag risky timing via Grok/OpenAI).
- Standalone hardware support for embedded projects (e.g., ESP32 displays with Square Line Studio UIs).
- Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) with PySide6 GUI.

This is an early-stage project‚Äîcontributions welcome!

## ‚ö° Features
- **Hex Editor**: View/edit ECU files (.bin, .hex, .rom) with search/replace and checksum correction.
- **Map Visualization**: Interactive 2D/3D fuel, timing, and boost maps using Plotly.
- **Datalog Viewer**: Import CSVs (e.g., from HP Tuners VCM Scanner), compute min/max values, real-time plotting, and AI-flagged issues (e.g., lean AFR spikes).
- **Safety Checks**: Automated warnings for limits (e.g., max timing, boost cut) with status badges.
- **Vehicle Compatibility**: Import/convert lists (e.g., HP Tuners vehicles to CSV) for ECU filtering.
- **Hardware Integration**:
  - ELM327 for basic OBD-II scanning and live logs.
  - J2534 for ECU flashing and diagnostics (e.g., PassThru APIs).
  - SavvyCAN for CAN bus logging/reverse engineering.
- **AI Enhancements**: Prompt-based analysis (e.g., "Optimize this fuel map") with optional Web3 signatures for secure tunes.
- **HP Tuners Specifics**: Min/max log extraction, tune modification detection, and MegaLog-compatible exports.
- **Future**: Embedded UIs via Square Line Studio for standalone hardware (e.g., like MoTeC Reflex for tuning/logging).

## üöÄ Quick Start with Google Jules
1. **Set Up Jules**:
   - Visit [jules.google.com](https://jules.google.com), sign in with Google, and connect your GitHub (Cashout-Performance/CashoutHexEditor).
   - Authorize the repo and configure a setup script (e.g., `pip install PySide6 plotly pandas obd requests`).

2. **Assign Tasks**:
   - Use the Jules UI to prompt tasks, e.g., "Add a datalog viewer with Plotly charts for HP Tuners CSVs."
   - Or label GitHub issues with "jules" for automation (e.g., "Implement J2534 flashing support").

3. **Review and Run**:
   - Approve Jules‚Äô PRs after reviewing diffs.
   - Clone locally: `git clone https://github.com/Cashout-Performance/CashoutHexEditor.git`.
   - Run: `python main.py` (ensure dependencies are installed).

4. **Test Features**:
   - Hex editing: Load a .bin and modify bytes.
   - Datalog: Import a sample HP Tuners CSV.
   - Hardware: Connect an ELM327 (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0) or J2534 device.

## üìã Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: See requirements.txt (install via pip).
- Hardware: Optional ELM327/J2534 adapters for live features.
- AI: Grok/OpenAI API key (free tier ok).

## ü§ù Contributing
We welcome contributions! Fork the repo, create a branch, and submit a PR.
- **Guidelines**: Follow PEP8, add tests, no proprietary code.
- **Ideas**: Add more ECU definitions, expand AI models, or hardware drivers.
- **Issues**: Report bugs or request features via GitHub Issues.
