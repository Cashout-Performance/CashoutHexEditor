**An original open-source ECU hex editor and tuning app with AI guidance, datalog viewing, and OBD2/J2534 integration.**  
Crafted in Python for automotive enthusiasts, this project draws inspiration from community tools while pioneering innovations like AI-assisted optimizations and robust hardware support. Developed through extensive research, it avoids proprietary code to ensure ethical progress.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
CashoutHexEditor redefines ECU tuning with a modern, free alternative to tools like WinOLS and TunerPro. It offers a unique blend of hex editing, interactive map visualization, real-time datalog analysis, and hardware interfaces (ELM327, J2534, SavvyCAN). Integrated with tuning ecosystems like HP Tuners, it supports safety checks, vehicle compatibility filtering, and optional Web3 signatures for secure tune exports.

Key highlights:
- AI-driven insights for map detection, tune optimization, and datalog analysis (e.g., identifying risky timing via external AI APIs).
- Support for standalone hardware projects, including ESP32 displays with customizable UIs via Square Line Studio.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux) using a PySide6-based GUI.

This is an early-stage, community-driven projectâ€”your contributions are warmly welcomed!

## âš¡ Features
- **Hex Editor**: View and edit ECU files (.bin, .hex, .rom) with search/replace and checksum correction.
- **Map Visualization**: Interactive 2D/3D fuel, timing, and boost maps powered by Plotly.
- **Datalog Viewer**: Import CSVs (e.g., from HP Tuners VCM Scanner), calculate min/max values, plot in real-time, and flag issues (e.g., lean AFR spikes) with AI support.
- **Safety Checks**: Automated limit warnings (e.g., max timing, boost cut) with visual status indicators.
- **Vehicle Compatibility**: Import and convert vehicle lists (e.g., HP Tuners data to CSV) for ECU selection.
- **Hardware Integration**:
  - ELM327 for OBD-II scanning and live logging.
  - J2534 for ECU flashing and advanced diagnostics.
  - SavvyCAN for CAN bus logging and reverse engineering.
- **AI Enhancements**: Prompt-based analysis (e.g., "Optimize this fuel map") with optional Web3 signatures.
- **HP Tuners Support**: Extract min/max logs, detect tune modifications, and export MegaLog-compatible data.
- **Future Roadmap**: Embedded UIs via Square Line Studio for standalone hardware (e.g., akin to MoTeC Reflex).
